/**
 * The class of MatÃ©rn kernels is a generalization of the Gaussian/RBF.
 * It has an additional parameter nu which controls the smoothness of
 * the kernel function. The smaller nu, the less smooth the approximated
 * function is. As {@code nu -> inf}, the kernel becomes equivalent to the
 * Gaussian/RBF kernel. When nu = 1/2, the kernel becomes identical to the
 * Laplacian kernel. The Matern kernel become especially simple
 * when nu is half-integer. Important intermediate values are 3/2
 * (once differentiable functions) and 5/2 (twice differentiable functions).
