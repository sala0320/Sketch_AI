/**
 * Shepard interpolation is a special case of normalized radial basis function
 * interpolation if the function &phi;(r) goes to infinity as r &rarr; 0, and is
 * finite for {@code r > 0}. In this case, the weights w<sub>i</sub> are just equal to
 * the respective function values y<sub>i</sub>. So we need not solve linear
 * equations and thus it works for very large N.
 * <p>
 * An example of such &phi; is <code>&phi;(r) = r<sup>-p</sup></code> with
 * (typically) {@code 1 < p <= 3}.
 * <p>
 * Shepard interpolation is rarely as accurate as the well-tuned application of
 * other radial basis functions. However, it is simple, fast, and often jut the
 * thing for quick and dirty applications.
