/**
 * Exponential variogram.
 * <p>
 *     v(r) = c + b * (1 - e<sup>-3r/a</sup>)
 * <p>
 * where a is the range parameter and b is sill paramter. The distance of two
 * pairs increase, the variogram of those two pairs also increase. Eventually,
 * the increase of the distance can not cause the variogram increase. The
 * distance which cause the variogram reach plateau is called range. The sill
 * parameter b is the maximum variogram value (by default, we set c = 0).
 * <p>
 * The parameter c is the so-called nugget effect. Though the value of the
 * variogram for h = 0 is strictly 0, several factors, such as sampling error
 * and short scale variability, may cause sample values separated by extremely
 * small distances to be quite dissimilar. This causes a discontinuity at the
 * origin of the variogram. The vertical jump from the value of 0 at the origin
 * to the value of the variogram at extremely small separation distances is
 * called the nugget effect.
